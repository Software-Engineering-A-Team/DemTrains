Keep a list of the shapes.
	- loop throught the shapes to check if a shape was clicked. Simple example below
	-   public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {
			last_x = rect.x - e.getX();
			last_y = rect.y - e.getY();
 
			// Checks whether or not the cursor is inside of the rectangle while the
			// user is pressing the mouse.
			if (rect.contains(e.getX(), e.getY())) {
			pressOut = false;
			updateLocation(e);
			

			
Simple algorithm for laying out the track

find the component by traversing through a 'graph' using breadth first algorithm.

1. If the next component is not drawn, draw the section straight.
2. If the next component is drawn, turn the section 90 degrees and draw it
3. If a connecting line can't be drawn, turn the section 90 degrees.
4. If a connecting line still can't be drawn after rotating the track, try moving the section forward
5. If it can't be done after moving the block forward, back track and go to step 2
